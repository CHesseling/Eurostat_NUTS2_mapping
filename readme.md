## A jupyter notebook (nightly build) to create maps from Eurostat's data ##

This notebook shows the example use of the EurostatAPI Python wrapper.

Please also take a look at (https://github.com/eurostat) and (https://github.com/gjacopo).

Note: I am a data journalist, not a coder. I am looking forward to suggestions for improvement
